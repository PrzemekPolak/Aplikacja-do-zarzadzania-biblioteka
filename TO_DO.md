# Possible upgrades

## Pdf generating
### Add to admin this function
#### List of all books

## add back/return button somewhere (for example in navbar)
## Button in UserDetails that sends user to addBorrowed with user initialData
## Add loading indicator
## When editing in datePicker Yup doesn't disable button when clearing date and picking the same one, because it got originally full date and time and now it only gets date
## red asterisks to standardText and error message to other components (example: ModalSelect in borrowed)
## borrowedEdit and ModalSelect has problems -> mainly initialData passed from EditBorrowedPage
## One book should be impossible to borrow when already borrowed

### search by date range
### Take care of all styles

#### Author list:
##### it shows author name and number of his books (unique (not including repeated ones) and all)
##### clicking shows list of all his books, eventually some statistical data

## router -> routes should be created iterating through array
## router -> actions and loaders if possible put in reusable functions
## add some ORM (preferably something with migrations options)
